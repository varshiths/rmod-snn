# rmod-snn

This project is an effort to implement a simplified implementation of a reinforcement learning agent operating on a POMDP, with the policy network modelled as a Spiking Neural Network.  

## Execution  

The project uses python 3.7. Consider setting up a virtual environment for the project.  

Run the file `main.py` with the relevant arguments to execute the model. A sample run is provided in the file `run.sh`.  
```bash
./run.sh
```
